## Exercise 3: Create a simple game to guess a person's name

<b>1.</b> Write a small game that requests a user to guess the name of a person. You may store the name as a <i>std::string</i> constant. 

<b>2.</b> Keep the game running in a loop until either the name has been correctly guessed or the user wishes to no longer play the game. 

<b>3.</b> Check if the user has the made a guess, guessed the name correctly or guessed the first letter of the name correctly. Display appropriate messages.

<b>4.</b> Before repeating the next iteration of the loop, ask the user if they wish to try again, and continue or end the loop accordingly. 

<b>5.</b> Error-trap your code as much as possible.
