## Create a game of <i>Hangman</i>

<b>1.</b> Create a game whereby the player needs to guess a word before his chances are up. <br>
<b>2.</b> Store a word in an array of <i>char</i> variables and allow the user to guess what the word is. <br>
<b>3.</b> The user should make guesses, one character at a time, and the application will loop through the array to find out if the letter exists in the word. <br>
<b>4.</b> For each incorrect guess, remove a life from the player (store the player lives as an integer value). <br>
<b>5.</b> If a player guess is correct, display that letter in the word, slowly revealing the entire word. <br>
<b>6.</b> The application will need to make us of loops, such that continuous guesses are being made and the word is updated with the correct letters. <br>
<b>7.</b> Add <i>ASCII</i> art to make the game look nicer. Try to display an actual hanging man as the wrong guesses are made. <br>
