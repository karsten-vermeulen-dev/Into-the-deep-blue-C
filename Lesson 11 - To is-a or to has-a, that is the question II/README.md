## Inheritance

Classes can share similar functionality and relate to each other in various ways. Inheritance allows for common features to be encapsulated in a base class and specific functionality to be contained in child classes derived from it. Furthermore, it allows for features and data of base classes to be passed down and extended in the derived class. This comprises deriving sub-classes from base classes and sub-classes can in turn be base classes to other objects as well. Base classes are known to be more generic whereas child classes are more specialised. Inheritance is modelled around the _is-a_ relationship.
