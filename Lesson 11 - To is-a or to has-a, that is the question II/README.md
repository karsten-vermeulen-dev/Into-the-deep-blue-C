## Containment

Up until now, all of our classes have been separate entities, with no real relation to each other. For instance, the _Cat_ and _Dog_ classes were created as individual objects without any relationships. Similarly, the _Player_ and _Enemy_ classes were treated separately as well, with little common ground. We will now find a way to associate classes with other classes and this can be done in two ways:

- _**Containment**_
- _**Inheritance**_
