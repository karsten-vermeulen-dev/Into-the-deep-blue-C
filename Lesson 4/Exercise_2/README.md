## Exercise 2: Create a simple inventory system

<b>1.</b> Create an application that displays a list of inventory items of a player. 

<b>2.</b> Use a loop to iterate through an array of <i>std::string</i> items, and then ask the user to enter another item for the player to carry. Make sure the loop continues to run until the user types <i>exit</i>. 

<b>3.</b> When displaying the items, check if they are vowels or consonants, and use the prefix <i>an</i> and <i>a</i> respectively. If the player isn't carrying anything, display something like <i>The player is carrying nothing</i>.

<b>4.</b> Set a maximum amount of items the player can carry. When that maximum has been reached, the player cannot carry anything else.
