## Lesson 21 - Algorithmic thinking

## Algorithms

Algorithms are specialized and templatized functions that allow us to perform various operations on various different containers. To make use of the built-in algorithms, the algorithm header file needs to be included: 

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
```

There are many different algorithms that can be used on the many different container classes, making them very powerful and efficient tools to use
