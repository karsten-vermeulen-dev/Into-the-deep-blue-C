## Create a parser

<b>1.</b> Write a function called <i>ParseString()</i> that takes in a <i>std::string</i> object and a <i>char</i> token that signifies where to split the string. <br>
<b>2.</b> The function should loop through the entire string and break it up into pieces where ever it finds the token. <br>
<b>3.</b> The broken string pieces should be stored in a separate <i>std::vector</i> of strings, preferably also passed to the function as an argument. <br>
<b>4.</b> Add a check to make sure the string is not empty. <br>
