## Create a calculator program

<b>1.</b> Create an application that requests the user to enter two different numbers and store them in variables. <br>
<b>2.</b> Using a menu, ask the user what they would like to do with the numbers, i.e. <i>add</i>, <i>subtract</i>, <i>multiply</i> or <i>divide</i> and store their choice as a numeric value or a symbol in a <i>char</i> variable. <br>
<b>3.</b> Check that only valid options are made. For example, if there are four options and the user selects a <b>6</b>, the menu should ignore that request or produce an error message. If you are using character symbols, make sure only valid symbols are input, i.e., '<b>+</b>', '<b>-</b>', '<b>x</b>', and '<b>/</b>'. <br>
<b>4.</b> Use <i>if/else-if/else/switch</i> statements to branch off and perform the operations. If you are familiar with functions, make sure that each operation is performed by its own function. <br>
<b>5.</b> Make sure that the menu system runs within a loop. As soon as an option has been made, and the numbers have been processed, make sure to return to the main menu. Keep the menu system running until the user chooses to exit the application. <br>
<b>6.</b> Add an option to calculate the remainder of a division. <br>
<b>7.</b> Make sure no errors occur when dividing by zero. <br>
<b>8.</b> Add <i>ASCII</i> art to make the menu and application look nicer.
