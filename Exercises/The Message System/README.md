## Create a game message system

<b>1.</b> Create a messaging system using a deque. The container should add <i>std::string</i> messages to the back and process them from the front. <br>
<b>2.</b> Pressing a key should process the next message from the front of the deque. <br>
<b>3.</b> Once the messages are removed from the front, they should be displayed. <br>
<b>4.</b> Incoming messages should be created randomly, using a set of pre-defined ones. <br>
<b>5.</b> For example, create messages along the lines of <i>Player has joined</i>, <i>Player has left</i>, <i>Player 2 has died</i>, etc. <br>
