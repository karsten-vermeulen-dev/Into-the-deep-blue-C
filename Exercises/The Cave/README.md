## The Cave

### Concepts you will improve on:

- Use of loops, enums, structs and branching

### Create a small game

<b>1.</b> Create a small game using a two-dimensional array that will represent the 'rooms' of the game.

<b>2.</b> Put the player into one of the rooms and add a menu to allow the player to choose which direction to move.

<b>3.</b> Check if the player can actually move in the chosen directon before moving them. For example, if the player is in the top left corner room, they will not be able to move up or left.

<b>4.</b> Use a struct to define a Position variable for the player's position. 

<b>5.</b> As the player moves, update their position visually using ASCII graphics.
