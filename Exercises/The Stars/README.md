## Use functions to create the following:

<b>1.</b> Write a <i>Stars()</i> function which prints out a line of stars. Use a loop within the function if you know how. The number of stars in the line is given as a parameter. So, your function signature is: <br>

```cpp
void Stars(int numStars);
```

<b>2.</b> Write a <i>Rectangle()</i> function, which draws a rectangle of stars. Use a loop here too, if you can. This function should take two parameters, one for width, and one for height. <br>

```cpp
void Rectangle(int width, int height);
```

<b>3.</b> Write a <i>HollowRect()</i> function, which only draws the rectangle outline. Do this iteratively.

```cpp
void HollowRect(int width, int height);
```

<b>4.</b> Write a <i>Triangle()</i> function that displays rows of stars, each row larger than the previous. Make sure the parameter passed reflects the maximum amount of rows required.

```cpp
void Triangle(int maxRows);
```

<b>5.</b> Write a <i>Diamond()</i> function, which renders rows of stars, each row larger than the previous. After the largest row has been rendered, draw smaller rows again. Pass in a parameter that determines how large the longest row should be.

```cpp
void Diamond(int maxRows);
```
