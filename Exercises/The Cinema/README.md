### Create a cinema seating arrangement

<b>1.</b> Create a single or multidimensional <i>char</i> array that will represent some form of seating arrangement within a cinema. 

<b>2.</b> Initialize the entire array with <b>A</b> values which means <i>available</i> since all seating in the cinema is currently free. 

<b>3.</b> Get the user to input which row and seat they would like to book and store that in separate variables. 

<b>4.</b> Access the specific seat in the cinema array and assign it a <i>reserved</i> value, using the character <b>R</b>. 

<b>5.</b> Use a nested <i>for-loop</i> to display the new cinema seating arrangement on-screen and make sure you clear the screen before. 

<b>6.</b> Use <i>constants</i>, such as <b>ROWS</b> and <b>SEATS</b>, which will store the row and column values of the array, and use them to declare the array.
