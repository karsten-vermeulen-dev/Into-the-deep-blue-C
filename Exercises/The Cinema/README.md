## Create a theatre seating arrangement

<b>1.</b> Create a multidimensional <i>char</i> array that will represent some form of seating arrangement within a theatre. <br>
<b>2.</b> Initialize the entire array with <b>A</b> values which means <i>available</i> since all seating in the theatre is currently free. <br>
<b>3.</b> Get the user to input which row and seat they would like to book and store that in separate variables. <br>
<b>4.</b> Access the specific seat in the theatre array and assign it a <i>reserved</i> value, using the character <b>R</b>. <br> 
<b>5.</b> Use a nested <i>for-loop</i> to display the new theatre seating arrangement on-screen and make sure you clear the screen before. <br>
<b>6.</b> Use <i>constants</i>, such as <b>ROWS</b> and <b>SEATS</b>, which will store the row and column values of the array, and use them to declare the array. <br>
