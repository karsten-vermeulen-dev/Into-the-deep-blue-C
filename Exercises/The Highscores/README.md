## Create a highscore system

<b>1.</b> Use a <i>std::map</i> called <i>highScoreTable</i> that will contain a list of player names and their highscore values. Populate the map with data. <br>
<b>2.</b> Loop through the map and output all of the data on screen. <br>
<b>3.</b> Add some more data to the map and remove some data as well. <br>
<b>4.</b> Search for a particular name in the map and display their high score. If the name is not found, display an appropriate error message. <br>
<b>5.</b> Create a <i>std::set</i> called <i>topScorers</i> that will contain all top scoring players. <br>
<b>6.</b> Loop through the map and find all players with a very high score, and add them to the set. Output the set data on screen. <br>
