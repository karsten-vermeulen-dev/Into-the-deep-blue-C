## Create a simple game menu system

<b>1.</b> Create a simple game menu with different options the user can choose from, such as <i>Play</i>, <i>Options</i>, <i>Help</i>, <i>Quit</i>. <br>
<b>2.</b> The user should be allowed to choose an option from the menu using a numeric value which corresponds to the menu item. <br>
<b>3.</b> Use <i>if/else-if/else</i> statements to display some text based on the user's choice. For example, if the user chooses to display the <i>Help</i> screen, then display something like <i>You chose the help screen</i>. <br>
<b>4.</b> Make sure that the menu system runs within a loop. As soon as an option has been made, make sure to return to the main menu. Keep the menu system running until the user chooses to exit the game. <br>
<b>5.</b> Check that only valid options are made. For example, if there are four options and the user selects a <b>6</b>, the menu should ignore that request or produce an error message. <br>
<b>6.</b> Add <i>ASCII</i> art to make the menu look nicer.
