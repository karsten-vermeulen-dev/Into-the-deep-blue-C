## Create an inventory

<b>1.</b> Create a <i>std::list</i> of <i>std::string</i> objects that will store a variety of inventory items. <br>
<b>2.</b> Create a loop that runs and asks the user to add items to the player's inventory. Store the user's desired item in the list, anywhere you like. The user should type <i>exit</i> to break out of the loop. <br>
<b>3.</b> For each iteration of the loop, clear the console screen, display the player's current items and prompt the user to enter more items. Make sure that items with a vowel are listed with <i>An</i> and the consonant items with <i>A</i>. For example, <i>An apple</i> or <i>A sword</i>. <br>
<b>4.</b> If the player is carrying nothing, the console should display something along the lines of <i>Our hero is carrying nothing at all</i>. <br>
<b>5.</b> Ask the user which item they want to remove and take that item out from the list. <br>
<b>6.</b> Use the <i>find()</i> algorithm to search for a particular item and remove that. <br>
