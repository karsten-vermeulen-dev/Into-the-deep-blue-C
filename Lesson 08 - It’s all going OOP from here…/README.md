## Lesson 7 - The anatomy of a _C++_ program

## The programming pipeline

For every application we develop with _C++_, it will likely flow through the same programming pipeline, namely: 

- _**Program**_ - This consists of the programmer writing the source code within source files
- _**Pre-process**_ - Before the source code is compiled, the preprocessor prepares it appropriately for the compiler, such as including any header files
- _**Compile**_ - The compiler converts the source code into a machine-readable language known as object files
- _**Link**_ - The linker binds together all the object files and other external files and libraries to produce an executable program
- _**Execute**_ - This is merely running the application
- _**Debug**_ - This is the process of analysing errors in the application and stepping through the code to diagnose any problems

## Debug & Release modes

There are two modes to create, build and run the application in, namely _Debug_ and _Release_ mode
