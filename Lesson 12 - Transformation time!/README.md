## Lesson 12 - Transformation time!

## Polymorphism

The last, and possibly most powerful, OOP technique we will demonstrate is _polymorphism_. As the name states, _poly_ means _many_ and _morphism_ means to _transform_, i.e. _multiple transformations of objects_. This OOP technique works with inheritance to allow specific and specialised functionality of derived classes. All child classes of a particular parent class share a common functionality and will behave differently based on what type of object has been created at runtime. Polymorphism is a very powerful, yet expensive, technique and only works properly if instantiating objects on the heap.
