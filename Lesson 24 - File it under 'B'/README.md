## Lesson 24 - File it under 'B'

## Binary files

Binary files store data in their binary format, with each chunk of data usually represented as 8-bit data pieces. Compared to text files, these type of files do not store the ASCII value of the data, but rather the raw binary data itself. They are a little more complex to deal with, and are used in games to store resource data, external libraries and tools, etc., and kept hidden from the player. Because they store data in binary chunks, a little more effort is needed to write data to and extract data from these types of files.
