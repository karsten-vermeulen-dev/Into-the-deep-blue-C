# Into the Deep Blue C++
A complete introductory to intermediate course covering the main _C++_ topics. Each lesson covers a different topic and is broken down into theory, code samples, and exercises. Extra challenges and code for small games are also available.

### Lesson 0 - Prologue
_A very brief introduction to the course, who the target audience is, and what makes this course so special_.

### Lesson 1 - Getting to know your environment
_You will be introduced to the C++ programming language, including where any why it is being used. You will also learn all about Visual Studio, where to download it and how to manage the IDE. Some tips and tricks will be covered to help you write code faster_.

### Lesson 2 - Refresh my memory
_In this lesson, you will learn all about variables, fundamental data types, and contiguous blocks of memory known as arrays_.

### Lesson 3 - Operator! Express yourself!
_Here, you will discover all the various different operators that come with C++ and learn how to use them_. 

### Lesson 4 - The loop & flow of a program
_In this lesson, you will learn how to branch your application, based on different conditions, as well as discover how to repeat different commands by using a particular loop_.

### Lesson 5 - Are you pointing at me?
_You will be taking a look at some special types of variables, namely pointers and references, and understand why they are so powerful and where and when they should or should not be used. You will also learn all about stack and heap memory and how pointers can allocate space on either_.

### Lesson 6 - Make it function!
_Here, you will cover ways to break all of your code into manageable chunks within functions. You will learn the basics of regular functions, including how to pass data to, and receive data from, them, before discovering recursive functions, function overloading and function pointers_.
