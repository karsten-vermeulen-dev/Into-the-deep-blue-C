# Into the Deep Blue C++
A complete introductory to intermediate course covering the main _C++_ topics. Each lesson covers a different topic and is broken down into theory, code samples, and exercises. Extra challenges and code for small games are also available.

### [Lesson 0 - Prologue](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%200%20-%20Prologue)

_A very brief introduction to the course, who the target audience is, and what makes this course so special_.

### [Lesson 1 - Getting to know your environment](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%2001%20-%20Getting%20to%20know%20your%20environment)

_You will be introduced to the C++ programming language, including where and why it is being used. You will also learn all about Visual Studio, where to download it and how to manage the IDE. Some tips and tricks will be covered to help you write code faster_.

### [Lesson 2 - Refresh my memory](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%2002%20-%20Refresh%20my%20memory)

_In this lesson, you will learn all about variables, fundamental data types, and contiguous blocks of memory known as arrays_.

### [Lesson 3 - Operator! Express yourself!](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%2003%20-%20Operator!%20Express%20yourself!)

_Here, you will discover all the many different operators that come with C++ and learn how to use those to manipulate your variables in memory_. 

### [Lesson 4 - The loop & flow of a program](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%2004%20-%20The%20loop%20%26%20flow%20of%20a%20program)

_In this lesson, you will learn how to branch your application, based on different conditions, as well as discover how to repeat different commands by using a particular loop_.

### [Lesson 5 - Are you pointing at me?](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%2005%20-%20Are%20you%20pointing%20at%20me)

_You will be taking a look at some special types of variables, namely pointers and references, and understand why they are so powerful and where and when they should or should not be used. You will also learn all about stack and heap memory and how pointers can allocate space on either_.

### [Lesson 6 - Make it function!](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%2006%20-%20Make%20it%20function!)

_Here, you will cover ways to break all of your code into manageable chunks within functions. You will learn the basics of regular functions, including how to pass data to, and receive data from, them, before discovering recursive functions, function overloading and function pointers_.

### [Lesson 7 - The anatomy of a _C++_ program](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%2007%20-%20The%20anatomy%20of%20a%20C%2B%2B%20program)

_In this lesson, you will take a deeper dive into the full pipeline of a working C++ program. From preprocessing to final execution, you will learn about all the different parts that work together to create an application. You will also learn about Visual Studio project folder structure, as well as debug and release modes_.

### [Lesson 8 - It’s all going _OOP_ from here...](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%2008%20-%20It%E2%80%99s%20all%20going%20OOP%20from%20here%E2%80%A6)

_Finally, the time has come to leave behind the woes of procedural programming and welcome the world of object-oriented programming. Here, you will gain an overview of encapsulation and learn all about classes and objects and how they are created and destroyed using constructors and destructors_.

### [Lesson 9 - Keep your members private](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%2009%20-%20Keep%20your%20members%20private)

_Here, you will learn all about abstraction and how you can create self-contained classes that don't need to expose their inner functionality to the outside world._

### [Lesson 10 - To _is-a_ or to _has-a_, that is the question I](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%2010%20-%20To%20is-a%20or%20to%20has-a%2C%20that%20is%20the%20question%20I)

_During the first part of this double-feature, you will focus on containment, composition and aggregation, and discover how all of this can be used to have one class consist of another, forming a has-a relationship_.

### [Lesson 11 - To _is-a_ or to _has-a_, that is the question II](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%2011%20-%20To%20is-a%20or%20to%20has-a%2C%20that%20is%20the%20question%20II)

_In the latter half, you will learn about inheritance, and how child classes can derive from their parent classes, forming a special kind of is-a relationship_.

### [Lesson 12 - Transformation time!](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%2012%20-%20Transformation%20time!)

_At this stage, you should be ready to delve into the last, and possibly most complex, OOP type – polymorphism! You will cover everything there is to know about this technique, what it's used for and how to properly implement it. At the end of this lesson, you will know all about abstract base classes, early and late binding and dynamic casting. What a mouthful!_

### [Lesson 13 - Operator! Overload yourself!](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%2013%20-%20Operator!%20Overload%20yourself!)

_You will learn all about operator overloading and how this powerful feature of C++ will allow you to make your operators behave in very different ways, in ways that you want them to behave_.

### [Lesson 14 - T.U. Template](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Into-the-deep-blue-C-/tree/main/Lesson%2014%20-%20T.U.%20Template)

_In this lesson, you will discover how to create 'empty shell' classes and functions that can be used later on to 'plug-in' different data types. Another powerful language feature worthy of a mention_.

### Lesson 15 - A brief overview of the Standard Library

_From strings to vectors, deques to maps, stacks to queues, you will be introduced to the Standard C++ Library and discover the various different containers and algorithms it holds_.

### Lesson 16 - Let's be smart about this

_After appreciating raw pointers, you are really going to appreciate smart pointers as you learn about unique, shared and weak pointers_.

### Lesson 17 - Have you tried the lambda?

_Nothing like a nice, big leg of lambda to avoid code duplication and tidy up the codebase. Here, you will learn all about these handy function objects that will allow you to create blocks of code to handle smaller tasks_.

### Lesson 18 - File it under 'T'

_Here, you will learn all about file handling, starting with reading from, and writing to, text files. You will look into different file handling flags, stream operators and file states_.

### Lesson 19 - File it under 'B'

_You will now look more into binary files and discover how the internal file pointers can manage raw data in a file. You will both write binary data to, and read data from, a .dat file, so that you can store data in files that a user cannot edit_.
