## Lesson 0 - Prologue

### So, what are we doing?

We are going to be learning to use and harness the power of the <i>C++</i> programming language. We will start off with the basics of the language, including <i>variables</i>, <i>functions</i>, <i>structs</i>, and <i>classes</i> before progressing into the land of <i>Object-Oriented Programming</i> or <i>OOP</i> for short, to discover how we can use this to write better programs. 
Thereafter, we will touch on some more intermediate topics such as <i>The Standard Library</i>, <i>templates</i>, <i>operator overloading</i>, <i>smart pointers</i>, and <i>lambdas</i>. Along the way, we will write a few <i>Win32 console applications</i> in order to practice using <i>C++</i>.

But most of all, we are going to have fun!

### So, who will be interested?

Anyone wishing to learn how to become a good, or better <i>C++</i> programmer will certainly appreciate the content of this course. Perhaps you are an avid application developer or a games programmer wanting to learn <i>C++</i>? You could be someone wanting or needing to learn <i>C++</i> for your current job or maybe you write audio plugins and need some extra help understanding something? Either way, this course has you covered and could just prove to be the right choice for you.

### What make this course so special?

There are many hundreds of paid and free <i>C++</i> courses out there, but not all of them are good. In this course, I will break this tough language down into bitesize chunks, so that you will truly understand all of the concepts. By the end of this course, you will understand what <i>C++</i> is all about and go on to write your own applications or use <i>C++</i> in existing environments. The course also includes plenty of exercises that you should attempt to practice and develop your <i>C++</i> skills.

### A few things to note

This course teaches <i>C++</i> using a <i>Windows 10</i> machine and <i>Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022</i>. However, the core <i>C++</i> concepts taught here remain the same, and you can easily transfer what you learn over into your own specific environment.
