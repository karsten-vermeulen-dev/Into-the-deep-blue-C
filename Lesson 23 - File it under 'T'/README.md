## Lesson 23 - File it under 'T'

## Text files

_C++_ provides a platform independent way of handling files, via its _Standard Library_, through _streams_. These streams need to be instantiated as stream objects and associated with actual physical files in order to perform file handling tasks. There are three main stream classes that can be used to manipulate files, namely _ifstream_, for reading from files, _ofstream_, for writing to files and _fstream_, for both input and output. Data can be written to and read from two types of files, namely _text files_ and _binary files_.
